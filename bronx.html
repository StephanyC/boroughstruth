<!-- <title>Boroughs Truth</title>
<p> The South Bronx is a experiencing a boom of building development. This is causing the rent and home sales prices to increase rapidly.
    The median rent in the bronx has been raised by 45% from 2005 to $1,130 in 2016. This increase badly affects the native from the borough 
    because the prices are becoming more expensive. Bronx natives had to live with the history of being called dirty by others from different 
    boroughs and bringing repect by creating change in our borough is important.

<h5>
    These two images of parks are intentionally used for black/white and nostaglic feeling because these are childhood parks that most bronx native from my neighborhood go to 
    and when we get older we look back at the memories that we made in that park.

<p>
  The South Bronx is now being called SoBro by real estate realtors to make more appealing to buyers for it can be related more to SOHO. 
   Places like Harlem and Brooklyn have been gentrified but they wrote Bronx off the market to being gentrified because they couldn't find an 
   angle to appeal the borough to the people that they wanted to sell the properties to.
