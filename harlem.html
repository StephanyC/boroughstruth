      <div class="overlay">Many buildings in Harlem are being gentrified and luxuorious buildings are being created to await new residents because natives can
        not afford to live in those buildings. Buildings in Harlem were very famous from the Apollo Theather that had amateur night were many artists such as singers
        and comedians. There were amateur night winners such as The Jackson 5, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Celia Cruz, and
        much more. Preserving the history of these buildings and the natives to Harlem as well since without them they wouldn't be any history.

      <img src="IMG/IMG-0824.jpg" alt="People that live in Harlem Crossing the Street" class="image">
      <div class="overlay">Everyday life of residents that live in Harlem. People have forgotten how rich the history of Harlem
        is because of their experience in the land but people wouldn't be paying millions for a brownstone if living in Harlem is not
        important. One of those forgotten moments was the Harlem Cultural Resnaissance over 30,000 people attended and several artists
        within the Black community such as B.B.King, Mongo Santamaria, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, and much more attended. The genres that was played
        during the Harlem Cultural Resnaissance was R&B, rock, gospel, soul & funk, blues and much more.

      <div class="overlay">Landlords started to find ways to increase the rent on their tenants. When the rent is controlled, the apartment
        would cost about $1000. While non-controlled rent
        can have the apartment costing $5000 a month. During 2000 to 2005, 32,000 African Americans moved out of Harlem
        because of the rent increase alone. During this time, 22,000
        White, Latinx and Asians moved in as residents. If we know impact of gentrification, why do we continue to do it?</div>
