  <!-- <h1>History of Gentrification in Harlem</h1> -->
  <!-- <h5> Harlem has a rich history which started when African Americans started migrated north from the south. This will
        lead to what we now know as the
        Harlem Renissance. The Black community flourished during this time with music, poetry, literature, dance, art,
        fashion,
        theatre, and politics. For Instance, Malcolm X gave his speeches of Civil Rights in Harlem. In Harlem Apollo,
        you had acts like
        Ella Fitzgerals and Louis Armstrong. With community like this, how could it get gentrified.
        During the late 80s and early 90s, Harlem was percieved as a poor area. Harlem had bad policing that stemed from
        racism, poor educational systems,
        poor healthcare, and increase of the population in unemployment. In the early 1990s, Harlem slowly came back to
        redevelopment which lead to crimes in the area
        decreasing, better transportation services which influenced other people to live in Harlem. Due to Harlem
        improving, the prices of residence started to go up.
        Landlords started to find ways to increase the rent on their tenants. When the rent is controlled, the apartment
        would cost about $1000. While non-controlled rent
        can have the apartment costing $5000 a month. During 2000 to 2005, 32,000 African Americans moved out of Harlem
        because of the rent increase alone. During this time, 22,000
        White, Latinx and Asians moved in as residents.
