            neighborhoods that were predonimantly Black and Latino. This lead to the decrease of Black 
            and Latino residents. This is displacement which is when homes or apartments are being left by 
            residents that can not afford the high prices. Brooklyn natives are leaving due to the big increase in price, 
            facing harassments from tenants and witholding repairs for they can get tenats that pay higher. Black Brooklyn is known as 
            areas in Brooklyn that have majority of the African American population. These areas would include Fort Greene, Clintin Hill
            Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Ocean Hill, Canarsie,Flatlands, East Flatbush, Flatbush, some parts of Bushwick,
            and some parts of downtown Brooklyn.</div>

            microagressions and racism. There was a limitation to the study that the census couldn't exactly be precise in identifying gentrification.</div>
