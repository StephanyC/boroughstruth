  <div class="container">
    <img src="IMG/IMG-1206.jpg" alt="Brownstone Building with trees in front" class="image">
    <div class="overlay">During the 1990s to 2000s using data collection from the Census, researchers found that middle class black families gentrifies low class
      black families because the neighborhood increased in value and there is racial diversity in the neighborhoods. This means that the family will experience less
      microagressions and racism. There was a limitation to the study that the Census couldn't exactly be precise in identifying gentrification. This brings to
      question how can gentification be identified accurately.

  <div class="container">
    <img src="IMG/IMG-1216.jpg" alt="The families now walking in the neighborhood" class="image">
    <div class="overlay">From 2000 to 2010, an increase of 6,700 to 15,6000 white people have moved into
      neighborhoods that were predonimantly Black and Latino. This lead to the decrease of Black
      and Latino residents. This is displacement which is when homes or apartments are being left by
      residents that can not afford the high prices. Brooklyn natives are leaving due to the big increase in price,
      facing harassments from tenants and witholding repairs for they can get tenats that pay higher. Black Brooklyn is known as
      areas in Brooklyn that have majority of the African American population. These areas would include Fort Greene, Clintin Hill
      Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Ocean Hill, Canarsie,Flatlands, East Flatbush, Flatbush, some parts of Bushwick,
      and some parts of downtown Brooklyn.

  <div class="container">
    <img src="IMG/IMG-1202.jpg" alt="Barclays Center" class="image">
    <div class="overlay">The development of the Barclays Center has increased amount of people living in the neighborhood and increased businesses in the
      area (restaurants,stores,and etc). According to pharmacy owner, in the article<i>The Barclays Center:Impact on the Community | Brooklyn's Sports:Past,Present,Future
      </i>, said that the development of the Barclay Center didn't increase profit for them, alot of residents had to leave to make space for the development of Barclays Center,
      and the development of Barclay Center increased the rent price.

  <div class="container">
    <img src="IMG/IMG-1214.jpg" alt="Brownstone" class="image">
    <div class="overlay"> A novel called <i> The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn</i>. The author called the people that moved from East River of Manhattan to Brooklyn gentrifiers. The landlords would commonly take 
      advantage of gentrification to make changes that best fit people that just started to live in Brooklyn. Most people starting to live in Brooklyn for the first time had white collar jobs. In 1971, a 
      survey was taken by brownstone owners and it revealed that people that just started living in Brooklyn were 99% white, 60% graduated, and 98.7% earning in the top five of New York households. They have alot 
      of buying power that the natives in Brooklyn do not.Therefore, Landlords try to accommodate the people that just started living in Brooklyn than the people living in Brooklyn for years.

  <div class="container">
    <img src="IMG/IMG-1381.jpg" alt="Luxurious Buildings" class="image">
    <div class="overlay"> More luxurious are being built in Brooklyn. Many of the luxurious buildings in <i> Williamsburg</i> was once a warehouse and factories. For example, there was a factory 
      called Domino Sugar factory. It was in redevelopment before it was shut down and sold to Two Tree Company. Two Tree Company made luxurious apartments which would make the rent more costly. 
      The more luxurious buildings being built will lead to increase of only certain amount of people that can rent the apartments which leads to others moving out causing displacement.
